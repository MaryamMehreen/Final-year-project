üë©‚Äçüíª User Flow (Frontend + Backend + Database)
1. User Registration / Login (if applicable)
Users (students) sign in to the platform.

Each user is identified by a unique username or email.

2. Starting the Quiz
After login or directly on homepage, the user clicks "Start Quiz".

The frontend displays MCQs or other quiz content.

AI Monitoring (Optional): Webcam/mic access may be requested for real-time invigilation (face detection, eye movement, tab-switch detection).

3. Attempting the Quiz
User answers all questions on screen.

Upon submission, their:

username

score

totalQuestions

timestamp

and optionally other metadata (like IP, webcam detection flags)
are sent via a POST request to the backend.

4. Backend API Processing
The backend receives quiz data at POST /api/quiz/submit.

Data is validated and stored in MongoDB using the Quiz model.

A response is sent confirming "Quiz submitted successfully".

5. MongoDB Storage (Compass View)
All submissions are saved under the quizapp database ‚Üí quizzes collection.

Each student's quiz attempt is stored as a separate document.

6. Admin Dashboard (Optional)
Admin can access GET /api/quiz/all to fetch and display all quiz attempts.

Displayed on frontend using tables or charts.

Useful for review, analysis, or detection of irregularities.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
